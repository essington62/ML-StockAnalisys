There is a high association between stock prices and events related to stocks on the web. Through social networks, people generate tremendous amounts of data that is filled with emotions. Much of this data is related
to user perceptions and concerns [29]. Sentiment analysis is a field of study that deals
with the people’s concerns, beliefs, emotions, perceptions, and sentiments towards some
entity.  This suggests that a good decision can be made by taking
the opinions and insights of large groups of people with varied types of information
Exploring sentiments from social media in addition to numeric time-series stock
data would enhance the accuracy of the prediction
Using time-series data as well as social media data would intensify the prediction accuracy


Furthermore, different algorithmic approaches have been used in SMP, such as the Support
Vector Machine (SVM), k Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN),
Decision Trees, Fuzzy Time-Series, and Evolutionary Algorithms.

he FIS (Fuzzy Inference Systems) apply rules to fuzzy sets and then
apply de-fuzzification to give crisp outputs for decision making [26]. The evolutionary
algorithms include gene-inspired neuro-fuzzy and neuro-genetic algorithms, mimic the
natural selection theory of species, and can give an optimal outp

sentiments have been proven to affect the market considerable, the most challenge part is to convert the textual information into numerical values so that it can be fed to a prediction
model.
 In addition, the detection of shorthand spellings, emoticons and sarcastic statements is yet another challenge.

 Previous studies have mostly considered the sentiment of textual data as positive or
negative [35,48,64]. A few studies have considered mood words to determine the mood of
a tweet, such as [8,58,65]

Furthermore, the extraction of textual data is a challenging task. The textual data
has many sources, such as financial news websites, general news, and social platforms

The previous studies considered several
textual sources for SMP, such as the Wall Street Journal [53], Bloomberg [22], CNBC and
Reuters [54], Google Finance [55], and Yahoo Finance [56].

Semantic frames are a rich linguistic resource. There has been much work on semantic frame parsers, but less that applies them to general NLP problems
